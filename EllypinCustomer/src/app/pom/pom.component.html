      <p>POM or payment-on-maturity is an ERC20 token that represents an asset with a fixed maturity that can be kept in safe custody at a bank or custodian.  Deposit and Redemption is in kind, except for interest payments and at maturity when the holder of record will be paid in PODs that the POM is denominated in. e.g if your POM is in €, you will get € PODs.  The asset backing of a POM will be homogeneous: same issuer, maturity and interest rate, 1-for-1. The POM custodian will collect payments on behalf of the POM holders and distribute according to their proportional holdings. Custodian will pay withholding tax and holders may seek refunds where eligible.</p>
      <p>A simple straightforward state-of -the art AML / CFT KYC check is conducted by our external expert on Buy and Redeem transactions. Painless to most people, but keeps out bad people. POMs can be traded, transferred peer-to-peer at the speed of crypto but with the intrinsic value of real-world  assets.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">How Does This Work ?</h2>
      <p>All processes are initiated only by the end-user. POMs are created when the appropriate asset is deposited and POMs are burned when redeemed.  Deposit and Redemption must be in standard units. In between they act like other tokens and can be transferred, approved, bought and sold. To start, click on the symbol below. This will take you to the customised POM page and which will automatically connect to your MetaMask  browser. The customised POM page is a safe and simple User Interface which has functions that enable you to access the common functions of the erc20 contract and Buy and Redeem functions. For the standard erc20 functions, you can also use MetaMask (speed setting fastest).</p>
