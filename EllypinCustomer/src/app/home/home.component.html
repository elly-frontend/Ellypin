					<h2>What is a POD ?</h2>
					<h2>What is a POM ?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>POD stands for Payment on Delivery and is an ERC20 token that represents an asset that is kept at a 1-to-1 ratio at a Custodian.</p>
					<p>POM stands for Payment on Maturity and is an ERC20 token that represents an asset with a maturity at a fixed date in the future and is also kept at a Custodian.</p>
					<p>PODs and POMs are Created when the asset is deposited, and are Burned when the asset is Redeemed. Always 1-to-1.Assets are not created out of thin air. The underlying asset is a real-world tangible asset and the PODs and POMs are digital assets, so they straddle both worlds and have 2 sets of functions: 1 that complies with real-world requirements and the other that operates on standard ERC20 functions and acts just like any other ERC20 token.</p>

					<p>We work with the banking system, and comply with KYC regulations when transactions occur in the real-world. During token Creation and Redemption, we will be in real-world mode. When in Digital mode, the token can be transferred peer-to-peer.The tokenization of PODs and POMs follows the Ellypin Tokenization Protocol.</p>

					<h2>The Ellypin Tokenization Protocol</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p>This is a publicly disclosed set of rules that govern the tokenization of real-world assets.</p>
					<p>These rules are created to make the Creation of the tokens, the transactions post-creation and the Redemption of assets and Burning of the tokens post-redemption safe, secure and transparent.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tokens are minted only upon deposit of the appropriate quantity and quality of the underlying real-world asset.</li>
						<li>The Custodian of the assets cannot be the Minter of the tokens.</li>
						<li>The Custodian and the Administrator will corroborate and verify each other in an armâ€™s length relationship.</li>
						<li>Once redeemed, the tokens are Burned.</li>
						<li>All actions are initiated by the Customer.</li>
						<li>There is proper record keeping. Records are maintained in an encrypted Database.</li>
						<li>The integrity of the system, the safety of the asset and the welfare of the Customer are paramount.</li>

					<p>Technically, we are using an open source ERC20 smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain on an enterprise-grade Cloud Computing platform. On top of the smart contract we have a custom Interface layer,  connected to an off-chain Database.</p>
					<p>The simple explaination is that the ERC20 smart contract is battle-tested, has a whole suite of ready-made supporting apps like MetaMask and MyEtherScan, and is brilliant at keepin track of the total number of tokens and the holdings of individual wallets, for digital assets. For real-world assets, it needs something more: a custodian to hold the assets, a KYC regime to weed out bad actors, and a confidential way to pass sensitive information like banking information. That's the Interface layer.</p>
					<p>The off-chain Database keeps track of the important information. The Custodian and Administrator check and balance each other.  The AWS Cloud Computing platform enables us to ramp up capacity to whatever is needed at very short notice.</p>
